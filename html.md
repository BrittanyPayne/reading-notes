# HTML SUMMARY 

##HTML pages are text documents. HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning. Tags are often referred to as elements. Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end. Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element. Attributes require a name and a value. To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do and where they go.

# TEXT SUMMARY
 
 ##HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).  They also provide semantic information (e.g. where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

# Summary IMAGES 

##The Error! Filename not specified  element is used to add images to a web page. You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the content of an image. You should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format. Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.
