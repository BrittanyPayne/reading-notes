block

A block statement (or compound statement in other languages) is used to group zero or more statements. The block is delimited by a pair of braces ("curly brackets") and may optionally be labelled:
var x = 1;
let y = 1;

if (true) {
  var x = 2;
  let y = 2;
}

console.log(x);
// expected output: 2

console.log(y);
// expected output: 1

Difference between Function constructor and function declaration

Functions created with the Function constructor do not create closures to their creation contexts; they always are created in the global scope. When running them, they will only be able to access their own local variables and global ones, not the ones from the scope in which the Function constructor was created. This is different from using eval with code for a function expression.
ar x = 10;

function createFunction1() {
    var x = 20;
    return new Function('return x;'); // this |x| refers global |x|
}

function createFunction2() {
    var x = 20;
    function f() {
        return x; // this |x| refers local |x| above
    }
    return f;
}

var f1 = createFunction1();
console.log(f1());          // 10
var f2 = createFunction2();
console.log(f2());          // 20
