Every day I face challenges as being a mother and a provider to make sure my children is safe In there sanity with peace. I know life could knock you down a lot as well but I try not to let my kids see me sweat to face those challenge. Once I knew having children wasn’t gone be easy well try raising them on your own being a single parent. It frustrating at times but I have it down pack. My effort with trying learn coding is a big step its something I would be interest in because am more of a teacher to teach children but I had to switch it up for a change and try something new, s far its ok its hard but ill get the hang up soon then I think only. My only problem is like u can show me one time and I can do it and mess up the first try instead of me asking hey can you show me more then once then I do example to make sure I have down pack. That’s when thing become more challenging. So I always ask myself just read the question again and again before typing or jotting down any answer because am assume am right when I know am wrong sometimes but it be the effort to know I tried. So hopefully I gain a lot from this class and I also know I have great team member in the class fonzo keep up the great work.
