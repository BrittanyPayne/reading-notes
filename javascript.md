WHAT IS A FUNCTION?

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).

ARITHMETI C OPERATORS

JavaScript contains the following mathematical operators, which you can use with numbers. You may remember some from math class.

DATA TYPES
•	NUMERIC DATA TYPE
•	STRING DATA TYPE
•	BOOLEAN DATA TYPE

VALU ES IN ARRAYS 
Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).

EXPRESSIONS 
An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions.
1.	EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE
2.	EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE
•	In order for a variable to be useful, it needs to be given a value. As you have seen, this is done using the assignment operator (the equals sign). var color = 'beige'; The value of co 1 or is now beige. When you first declare a variable using the var keyword, it is given a special value of undefined. This will change when you assign a value to it. Technically, undefined is a data type like a number, string, or Boolean.
•	You can perform operations on any number of individual values (see next page) to determine a single value. For example: var area = 3 * 2; The value of area is now 6. Here the expression 3 * 2 evaluates into 6. This example also uses the assignment operator, so the result of the expression 3 * 2 is stored in the variable called area.
